# Constellation Training

[Constellation](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation) is a 
graph-focused data visualisation and interactive analysis application enabling 
data access, federation and manipulation capabilities across large and complex 
data sets.

While it provides significant capability out of the box, it has been designed 
with extensibility and modularity in mind. There are two prominent ways of 
extending Constellation, namely through its views or by creating plugins.

Views appear as windows in the application and provide visualisation of and 
interaction with the graph.

Plugins perform operations on the graph. In addition, there are several other 
ways that Constellation can be customised, including defining new attributes or 
even your own custom graph.

This guide will introduce you to the most common ways to customise Constellation 
in order to solve domain-specific problems. Each chapter will introduce a new 
concept interspersed with a series of practical exercises. These exercises will 
build on each other to form a complete solution to a hypothetical scenario.
