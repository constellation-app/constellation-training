# Constellation Training

[Constellation](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation) is a 
graph-focused data visualisation and interactive analysis application enabling 
data access, federation and manipulation capabilities across large and complex 
data sets.

## Analyst Training

The `Analyst Training` folder contains a series of self paced exercises you can 
follow to become fluent with using Constellation starting with the basics of 
"why graphs?" in exercise 1 and move up all the way up to doing network analysis 
with Constellation and Python in exercise 10. Answers to exercises are also 
provided to verify your learning.

* Exercise 1 - Why Graphs
* Exercise 2 - Introduction to Constellation
* Exercise 3 - Histogram View
* Exercise 4 - Selecting in Constellation
* Exercise 5 - Putting it Together - Checkpoint
* Exercise 6 - Map View and Location Data
* Exercise 7 - Conversation View and Content Data
* Exercise 8 - Analytic View and Social Network Analysis
* Exercise 9 - Clustering and Similarity
* Exercise 10 - Network Analysis With Python

If you have any feedback or have questions then feel free to submit an issue to 
[here](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation) and we will get back 
to you. We also welcome any contribution to exercises.

## Developer Training

Constellation provides significant capability out of the box, it has been 
designed with extensibility and modularity in mind. There are two prominent ways 
of extending Constellation, namely through its views or by creating plugins.

*Views* appear as windows in the application and provide visualisation of and 
interaction with the graph.

*Plugins* perform operations on the graph. In addition, there are several other 
ways that Constellation can be customised, including defining new attributes or 
even your own custom graph.

This guide will introduce you to the most common ways to customise Constellation 
in order to solve domain-specific problems. Each chapter will introduce a new 
concept interspersed with a series of practical exercises. These exercises will 
build on each other to form a complete solution to a hypothetical scenario.

### Special Instructions 
> Presently we are in the process of migrating our repositories from NetBeans 8 to 
NetBeans 11. Everything is up to date besides the training documentation. Until 
this is updated, you will need to checkout this 
[commit](https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation-training/commit/89c394624ac18b574104af03863924a30cc3ea90)
